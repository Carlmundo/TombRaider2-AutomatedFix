5.	Upon completion of installation, run Setup to make sure your 
	graphics card is configured properly.
6.	Click the Play button on the Autorun Menu or select Tomb 
	Raider II in the Core Design folder on the Start Menu to begin 
	the game.


Setup
-----
There are a large number of options available in the Setup window, which 
allow you to configure the graphics, sound and controls within the game. 
You may need to change some of the graphics settings to achieve the best 
possible performance (frame rate and detail level) on your particular 
graphics card.  Please refer to the Technical Help section for more 
details on graphics configuration.

The Setup window is accessed by clicking the Setup button on the Autorun 
Menu, or by selecting Setup Tomb Raider II from the Start menu.  Click on
one of the five tabs to select the page of options associated with it. 
The tabs available are:

Options
The Options page displays a list of your current graphics, sound and 
joystick settings.

Graphics
You are able to completely configure your graphics card settings on this 
page.

Graphics Card		Switch between your Primary Display Driver and 
			the 3Dfx drivers (if available)

Graphics Output Method	If you have a 3D accelerator card, Hardware 3D 
			Acceleration will be available, otherwise you 
			will have to use the Software 256 Color Renderer,
			which will run the game without requiring a 
			hardware accelerator.

Graphics Options:

Z Buffer		Speeds the process of drawing polygons to the 
			screen
Bilinear Filter		Smoothes out textures
Dither			Improves colors
Triple Buffer		May increase speed slightly, not supported by 
			some cards
Perspective Correct	Eliminates inaccuracies and warping
Display Type		Run the game Full Screen or Windowed
Full Screen Mode	If Full Screen is selected, you will be able to 
			select the resolution and color level in this 
			drop down menu.  The higher you set the 
			resolution and color level, the	higher the detail
			will be, but there will also be a loss of frame 
			rate and possible texture drop out.  Many cards 
			run very efficiently at 640x480 High Color.
Windowed Mode		When Windowed is selected, use the slider to set 
			the resolution.  You can select	the Width:Height 
			ratio at the bottom.
Test Settings		Once you have configured the graphic settings, 
			click the Test button to make sure your graphic 
			card can operate under the current settings.  
			PASSED indicates that the game will run properly.
			FAILED means you will not be able to run the game
			with the current settings.
Use Defaults		By clicking on this button, you will be able to 
			change your graphics options back to the original
			settings when the game was first run.

Sound

Sound Card		Choose between the DirectX Primary Sound driver,
			and the sound card's own Direct sound driver
Microphone Position	The microphone can follow the camera or always be
			placed on Lara
Sound Output		Enable Sound will enable the sound effects (not 
			CD audio).  Click Test to make sure your sound 
			card is functioning properly.

Controls

Joystick		Select which joystick or gamepad to use
Configure Joystick	Click Run Control Panel to open the Control Panel
Joystick Input		Enable or disable input from the joystick

Advanced:

Most users will want to leave the advanced settings as they are - 
changing these settings will affect the look of the game, but may 
increase frame rate.  The default advanced settings leave the Various 
graphics options unchecked and Always adjust is selected under Texel 
Adjustment.

Disable FMV		When this is checked, the Full Motion Videos in 
			the game will be disabled.


NOTE: If you own a 3D accelerator card, please read the 3D Graphic Cards 
and Technical Help sections.  They may contain important information 
related to your card, which you will need in order to get Tomb Raider II 
to run properly.

Trouble-shooting
----------------

General tips:

There are many 3D accelerator cards available on the market, and they all
will perform differently under the same conditions, depending on the 
chipset, amount of video memory, and drivers installed.  The key to 
getting the best performance out of your graphics card is to set the 
card to a higher resolution, while maintaining a good frame rate with no 
texture loss. Many accelerator cards will run Tomb Raider II very 
efficiently at 640x480 High Color.

If you notice texture drop out - white blank spots on menu text, objects,
terrain and characters including Lara, you will need to lower the 
graphics resolution.  The card has run out of texture memory.  The 
graphics resolution can be changed in the setup window, and can also be 
changed in-game by using the F1 key to lower the resolution, and F2 to 
raise the resolution.  Turning off Z-Buffering may help to fix this 
problem as well.  Use the F7 key to toggle Z-Buffering on and off.  If 
the results are unsatisfactory, you can run the game in software mode by 
running Setup, and selecting Software 256 Colour Renderer.

If you are experiencing very low frame rates, you may want to lower the 
screen resolution.  You can also reduce the screen size, which will leave
a border around the viewable area. The F3 key will reduce the screen 
size, and the F4 key will increase the screen size. Reducing the 
resolution and screen size will help Tomb Raider II run faster.

On some 3D cards, seaming may occur, drawing borders around polygons.  
This is most apparent when looking at the sky, which will have a tiled 
look to it.  Turning off bi-linear filtering may help to fix this 
problem.  Bi-linear filtering can be toggled on and off by pressing the 
F8 key.

When using the Hot Keys in-game to increase the resolution, you will have
to be a little careful.  Some of the graphic options such as Z-Buffering 
can be supported at lower resolutions, but may not be supported at higher
resolutions.  If you increase the resolution in-game to a resolution 
which does not support the currently selected graphics options, the game 
may crash your system.  For example, the 3Dfx card will not run the game 
with Z-Buffering on in 800x600 High Color mode.  If you have Z-Buffering 
on, and increase the resolution in-game to 800x600 the game will crash.

If you are getting any errors when running the game, such as runtime C++ 
error, or cannot find dinput.dll, reinstall DirectX 5.0.  DirectX 5.0 
can be installed directly from the Tomb Raider II CD by running the 
dxsetup.exe program from the directx directory.

If you continue to have problems, please contact your hardware 
manufacturer.

3D Graphic Cards:

Tomb Raider II supports all 100% Direct3D compliant graphic cards.  This 
means that Tomb Raider II will run on every 3D accelerator card, 
providing that you have installed DirectX 5.0, and you have installed 
drivers for your 3D card which support all of the features of DirectX 5.0
required by Tomb Raider II.

Graphics card manufacturers constantly update their drivers.  If you are 
running the game on a 3D accelerator card, make sure you have the latest 
drivers available for your card.  See the Tomb Raider II Related Web 
Sites section for a list of web sites where you will be able to obtain 
the very latest drivers for your graphics card.

Known issues:

Rendition Verite 1000

On certain Rendition Verite 1000 cards, Tomb Raider II may crash out to 
the desktop immediately after the copyright screen is displayed, due to 
an inability to play the Full Motion Videos.  If you experience this 
problem, you can turn off the FMV's in the game, by selecting the 
Advanced tab in Setup, and checking the Disable FMV box.  If you wish to 
view the FMV's in the game, updated drivers for your Rendition card are 
included on the CD, in the Drivers\Rendition 1000 directory.  This set 
of drivers is more recent than the drivers installed by DirectX 5.  
Installation instructions are provided in the readme file in the same 
directory.

DirectX 5.0 will replace your Rendition card manufacturer's drivers, 
with the generic drivers that are included with DirectX 5.0.  You may 
need to go back to your original drivers, in order to get the game 
working properly.  The easiest method to accomplish this is:

1. Right-click on the desktop and select Properties.
2. In the Display Properties, click on the Settings tab.
2. Select Change Display Type or Advanced Properties.
3. At the top of the screen, your Adapter should be listed as "Rendition 
   Verite".  Click the Change button on the right, and you will see a 
   list of available drivers for your graphic card.
4. Click on the driver that is NOT labeled Rendition Verite and click OK.

S3 Virge VX/GX/DX

If you experience any problems with your S3 Virge VX/GX/DX card, the 
latest drivers are available on the Tomb Raider II CD in the 
Drivers\S3 Virge directory.  Installing these drivers will help to fix 
problems that you may encounter.

PowerVR PCX1

On PowerVR cards with the PCX1 chip, the text in all of the menus may not
be displayed to the screen.  To fix this, turn off Z-Buffering by 
pressing the F7 key, or make sure that the Z Buffer option is unchecked 
in the graphics setup screen.  Watch for the release of updated drivers 
from Power VR which may completely fix this problem.

3Dfx Voodoo I and II

In rare instances, Tomb Raider II will not detect 3Dfx cards.  If you 
have a 3Dfx card installed, and experience this problem, it is probably 
because the 3Dfx driver is listed under the Multimedia heading, instead 
of Sound, video and game controllers in the System Properties/Device 
Manager.  You will need to get the latest 3Dfx drivers for your card, 
remove your current drivers and install the new drivers.

3Dfx Voodoo Rush  (Intergraph Intense 3D & Hercules Stingray)
The 3Dfx Voodoo Rush cards are properly detected by Tomb Raider 2.  
The game will list the available driver under Graphics Card as "Primary 
Display Driver".   This is the Direct3D driver that enables TR2 to run 
properly with a great number of 3D cards, including the Voodoo Rush cards.  

While running TR2 on the Voodoo Rush cards, if the graphics tend to 
flicker or blink, you will need run Setup Tomb Raider II, and turn on 
all of the Graphics options under the Graphics tab, including Triple 
Buffer.  This should alleviate the problem.

CD-ROM drives:

If you have a computer system with more than 1 CD-ROM drive, or a CD 
changer - Tomb Raider II runs most efficiently when the TRII CD is in the 
first CD-ROM drive.  The game will run in any of the CD drives, but you 
may not get redbook CD audio, and you may experience some slowdown.  
Depending on your hardware configuration, the game will sometimes try to 
stream data from the primary CD drive.  In order to get the best 
performance, we recommend using the first occurring CD-ROM drive (or slot
if a multi-changer) with Tomb Raider II.

If your CD-ROM drive will not recognize the Tomb Raider II disk, try the following:

Open your CONTROL PANEL, then select SYSTEM, then choose PERFORMANCE, and then click on the FILE SYSTEM button.  Then choose CD-ROM, and change the Supplemental Cache Size for the CD drive to small and Optimize Access for Double Speed driver, or no read ahead (older titles). 

Sound Cards:

Tomb Raider II requires that you have a sound card which fully supports 
DirectX 5.0.  If you are getting loud static popping, or get no sound 
effects at all, you will need to update your sound card drivers to 
drivers that are compatible with DirectX 5.0.  Please note that some 
sound card manufacturers do not have DirectX 5.0 compatible drivers yet.  
Until there is a driver available, you can try reducing the Wave volume 
in Volume Control.  Double-click on the small speaker on the Windows 
task tray to open Volume Control.

Joysticks & Gamepads:

Tomb Raider II supports a wide variety of Windows 95 compatible game 
controllers.  However, there are no default settings for the joystick 
buttons, so you will need to assign the various controls to the joystick 
buttons yourself.

At the Main Title screen, highlight Controls (cursor keys icon) and press
the Enter key.  The Default Keys should now appear on screen.  Press the 
right cursor key to bring up the User Keys screen.  It is here that you 
will be able to assign the joystick buttons.  Highlight the particular 
control you want to assign by using the cursor keys.  Press the Enter key
to select that control, and then press the joystick button you wish to 
use.  The text will flash on and off if you have assigned two controls 
to the same button.  Once you have assigned controls for all of the 
joystick buttons, press the ESC key to exit the Controls screen.
