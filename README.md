## Advanced Configuration (optional)
To change settings, you need to start by opening the game's folder.
For Golden Mask settings, you need to then open the "gold" folder.

* Run "Configure.bat" to change most settings.
* If you change resolution, you should also edit "dgVoodoo.conf", scroll to the bottom and input the new resolution there in the format "Resolution = h:1920, v:1080" (where 1920x1080 would be your resolution)
